Welcome to Spawn's Documentation!
=================================

Spawn provides a unique and user-friendly way of specifying large combinations of simultations in a simple and easy-to-read (and write!) input file.

Read :ref:`Spawn Input File Definition` to discover how to build your first Spawn spec file.

If you're using the command line interface, take a look at :ref:`Spawn Command Line Interface`.

A full :ref:`API Reference` is also provided.
